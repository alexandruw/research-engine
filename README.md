Research Engine
===============

This project aims to bring together some of the most useful tools in a researcher's daily work. It is intended to be a place to facilitate the organization of knowledge, ideas and resources needed to do research. This project also stems from the spirit of [Open Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science) trying to make non-sensitive content freely accessible to anyone thus facilitating and potentiating research capabilities.

The framework used is [Google's App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/) with Python 2.7. You can access this application on it's [Appspot website](http://research-engine.appspot.com/) however it's not anywhere near to provide even basic functionality at this time. 

I will provide some documentation and status updates in the doc/ folder.

## Motivation ##

> *I believe that the process of science - how discoveries are made - will change more in the next twenty years than it has in the past 300 years.* Michael Nielsen. *Reinventing Discovery* (2012).

> *Rather, knowledge is becoming inextricable from - literally unthinkable without - the network that enables it. Our task is to learn how to build smart rooms - that is, how to build networks that make us smarter, especially since, when done badly, networks can make us distressingly stupider.* David Weinberger. *Too Big To Know* (2012).

Online tools are becoming essential in modern research, however there isn't any integrated services. I find myself hopping around between my email, calendar, RSS reader, [Mendeley](http://www.mendeley.com/), [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org/) blog, [MediaWiki](http://www.mediawiki.org/) site and several other services during a typical day and I am still lacking some tools to improve my teaching and collaborate with colleagues in many respects.

It is my intention to bridge that gap as best as I can. I am not a *professional* programmer but I hope to make a concept-design good enough to gain some collaboration later on.


## Overview ##

As I envision, the work of a researcher fall into three closely related categories:
- **Learning:** This includes general references like textbooks or [Wikipedia](http://www.wikipedia.org) but also specialized resources like journal articles, conferences, webinars and online courses.
- **Teaching:** Researchers are often required to provide lectures to new students but there are many other *teaching* activities like writing divulgation articles for a general public, maintaining a repository of specialized knowledge or giving a talk in a conference. I would also include here giving an opinion about other people's articles.
- **Production:** The actual *meat* of research is producing new knowledge and advancing the scientific understanding. This often (but not always) involves writing articles and submitting them to journals. I think we particularly lack tools to work un collaboration. 


## Installation ##

If you want to play around with the code you will need [Google's App Engine](https://developers.google.com/appengine/), please look into their documentation for instructions on how to get an instance working on your machine. If you want to make it public you will also need to register an app.
