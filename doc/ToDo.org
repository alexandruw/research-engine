#+TITLE: Status updates and roadmap of future features.
#+DATE: <2012-09-17 Mon>

In this file I will keep brainstorming ideas about development of the project.

* [1/7] Brainstorm
** TODO Look into [[http://www.crossref.org][CrossRef's API]] to find a way to retrieve article's metadata.
** TODO Is [[http://mendeley.com/][Mendeley]] a better choice to resolve article's metadata?
** TODO Have a look at [[https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/][Course Builder]] to see if I can/should integrate it with my project.
** TODO I should ask some colleagues to know what features they would love.
** TODO Find a way to integrate Google Reader and be able to parse (and subscribe to) RSS feeds.
** TODO Check out App Engine's Memcache facilites.
** DONE Make an "About" section with a link to the [[https://github.com/andresgsaravia/research-engine][github repository]].
   Done in the footer area
* [1/2] Documentation
** TODO Start the User's Manual documents.
** DONE Write about each of the three major lines in the README file.
   However I should write some more in the future
* [1/3] Authentication
** TODO Facebook authentication?
** TODO Integrate Google Login to the accounts.
** DONE Create new account from scratch.
* [0/2] Debugging
** TODO I should start adding some assertions and/or logging statements should a bug appear.
** TODO I need a test unit reachable only to administrators.
* [1/7] Collaborative writing/reviewing of papers.
  All related to write a paper with collaboratos
** TODO [0/4] Add references to the current paper
*** TODO Parse article's metadata from DOI using [[http://www.crossref.org][CrossRef]]
*** TODO Save new article in database
*** TODO Link article to current paper
*** TODO Add comments to the article
** TODO Add collaborators to the paper
** TODO Version control
** TODO Status of the paper
** TODO Submission history
** TODO Peer review process (open to anyone after acceptance by journal?)
** DONE Where should this be located?
   In the "Collaborations" menu, of course...
* [0/1] Miscellaneous
** TODO Meanwhile write something in the front page.
* [0/3] Design
** TODO In the settings, login and logout page the error messages should not displace the text-input boxes.
** TODO Center the footer correctly
** TODO The menu items should be centered around the main content, not the whole page.
