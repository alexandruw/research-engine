In this file I will keep brainstorming ideas about development of the project.

* [0/5] To Do
** TODO Write about each of the three major lines in the README file.
** TODO Look into [[http://www.crossref.org][CrossRef's API]] to find a way to retrieve article's metadata.
** TODO Is [[http://mendeley.com/][Mendeley]] a better choice to resolve article's metadata?
** TODO Have a look at [[https://code.google.com/p/course-builder/][Course Builder]] to see if I can/should integrate it with my project.
** TODO I should ask some colleagues to know what features they would love.
